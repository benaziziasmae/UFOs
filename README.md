# UFOs

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Overview of the project 

This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.
In order to perform their analysis, users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.
